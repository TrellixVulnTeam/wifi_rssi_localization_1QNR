# Indoor-wifi-localization

With the passage of time, the importance of the global positioning system has increased exponentially in our lives.
Most of the apps these days use the GPS technology as one of their major underlying components. Be it google maps, uber eats,
Ola or any other company, GPS is widely used in our daily lives. Seen all the pros of GPS, it has some cons too. 
The simple and basic requirement of GPS is the line of site. These systems thus perform tremendously well outdoors but
canâ€™t be used for indoors. We have utilized this opportunity to create an indoor positioning system which will be able
to cater to the shortcomings of the GPS system. The indoor positioning system aims to help navigate within a closed premise
where there are enough access points and WIFI connection availability. This indoor positioning system will use the received 
signal strength values from the various access points and match them in a database with the stored signal strength values
corresponding to various different co-ordinates. The signal strength values will also be used to perform the trilateration
process and the results of the fingerprint matching process will be augmented by this trilateration process in order to 
improve the accuracy. We aim to deploy this project in our college premise where there are enough access points thus 
helping in saving the time which people waste when looking for a teacher, guard or a lab. This automated and user-friendly
service will be available to the users, students, teachers via an android app installed on their phone.
